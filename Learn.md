# Learning Through Project

An easy-to-use budgeting calculator, will help users to understand their expenses and manage their money. I hope this project will help students to understand JavaScript concepts as I have implemented all the basic concepts of JavaScript. Moreover, I have used Bootstrap and CSS to make this website fully responsive. "Local storage" is used to store and maintain calculation history. I used Azure Static Web Apps service to host this website.
