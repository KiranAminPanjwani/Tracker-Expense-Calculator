I hope this project will help students to understand JavaScript concepts as I have implemented all the basic concepts of <b>JavaScript</b>. Moreover, I have used <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>CSS</b> to make this website fully responsive. "<b>Local storage</b>" is used to store and maintain calculation history. I used <b>Azure Static Web Apps</b> service to host this website.
