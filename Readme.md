## Working:
After entering to our website, user will be able to either use the calculator in the guest mode or by signing in to their account. 
- Guest mode can be accessed by clicking the "Get Started" button available on the home page. The user can use the calculator in guest mode without creating an account. However, without logging into the user's account will prevent them from saving their records.
- User must log in either manually or using credentials in order to save the record. </br>
  There are 4 options on the login form:
  1) Use GitHub to sign in
  2) Use Twitter to sign in
  3) Use a Google account to sign in
  4) Enter your email address and password to log in. (Before logging in, user must Signup.)

Without logging into their account, users can compute their spending using the guest mode. In this mode, the ability to save records is limited, and the username will not be displayed in the upper right corner.
